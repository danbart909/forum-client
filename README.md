# Title: Thinkful Forum (Client)

## Description

This is a forum designed as an alternate form of communication between classmates. Note that after registering, you will be taken to the login screen to enter your new username and password instead of logging you in automatically.

Guests can register an account and login with it, enabling them to post new threads or post new replies to existing threads. Users can delete their replies or threads (as long as the thread has no replies), as well as edit them.

## Landing Page Intro

Welcome to the Thinkful Forum, envisioned an alternate means of communication between students in my cohort.

Use the 'Forum' link in the navbar to access the main forum from anywhere. 'Homepage' will link back to this page.

The usernames Batman, Superman, and Lex Luthor and all open to guests. The password to these users is simply 'password'.

The current design was made with mobile in mind and as a result it is, for now, better viewed with a smaller screen.

You may register with your own username and password and post at your leisure. Note that after registering, instead of being automatically logged in, you will be taken to the login page where you can then login with your newly created username and password.

## Installation

```
npm install
```

Nothing is required beyond the initial 'npm install'. All required dependencies should be downloaded.

## Dependencies/Tech Info

The client is based on react, and everything needed is obtained via npm install. Nothing extra is needed to make this work.

HTML, Javascript, CSS, React
